# Users, Roles & Permissions Feature - Progress Update

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the user management, roles, and permissions system for the pyERP application.

## Features Implemented

### Models
- **UserProfile**: Extension of Django's User model with additional fields:
  - Department, position, phone, language preference
  - Profile picture
  - Account status (active, inactive, pending, locked)
  - Two-factor authentication flag
  - Last password change tracking

- **Role**: Extends Django's Group model for organizing permissions at a functional level:
  - Description and priority
  - System role flag
  - Hierarchical structure with parent-child relationships

- **PermissionCategory**: Organizes permissions into logical categories for UI representation:
  - Name, description, icon
  - Ordering capability

- **PermissionCategoryItem**: Maps Django permissions to categories:
  - Ordered list of permissions within categories

- **DataPermission**: Row-level security model for object-level permissions:
  - User or group-based permissions
  - Generic foreign key for applying to any model
  - Permission levels (view, edit, delete, full access)
  - Metadata tracking (creation, expiration)

### Services Layer
- **UserService**: Handles user-related operations:
  - Group assignment and removal
  - Status management
  - Filtering by department and status
  - User creation with profile data

- **RoleService**: Manages roles and group relationships:
  - Role creation with permissions
  - User-role querying
  - Hierarchical role traversal

- **PermissionService**: Handles complex permission operations:
  - User permission aggregation
  - Object-level permission checking
  - Filtered object querying based on permissions
  - Permission categorization for UI

### API Views
- **UserViewSet**: Complete CRUD for users with additional endpoints:
  - Group assignment/removal
  - Status updates
  - Department and status filtering

- **UserProfileViewSet**: Manages user profile data
  - Department filtering

- **GroupViewSet**: Django group management with:
  - User listing
  - Permission management endpoints

- **RoleViewSet**: Role management with:
  - User listing
  - Child role hierarchy management

- **PermissionViewSet**: Read-only permission access with:
  - Category-based organization

### Admin Interface
- Custom admin interfaces for all models
- Inline editing of UserProfile within User admin
- Enhanced filtering and search capabilities

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- Django's built-in authentication system
- Django REST framework for API endpoints
- django-guardian for object-level permissions

### Database Considerations
- Uses PostgreSQL for advanced querying capabilities
- Maintains referential integrity with appropriate foreign key relationships
- Optimized for common query patterns

## Next Steps
- Frontend implementation of user management interface
- Role-based access control in the UI
- Comprehensive testing
- Permission auditing and reporting
