# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

**Current Coverage:** 8% overall

## 1. Priority Areas

Based on the coverage report, the following areas need immediate attention:

1. **Core Modules** (8% coverage)
   - Validators
   - Form validation classes
   - Core utility functions

2. **Product Modules** (10% coverage)
   - Models have good coverage (97%)
   - Focus on views, forms, and business logic

3. **Legacy Sync Modules** (0% coverage)
   - Critical integration points
   - Data transformation logic

4. **Management Commands** (minimal coverage)
   - Focus on command logic and error handling

5. **Views and API Endpoints** (minimal coverage)
   - Focus on request handling, authentication, and response formatting

## 2. Test Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Framework (Weeks 1-2)

1. **Complete validator test coverage**
   - Finish any remaining validator tests
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - ✅ Fixed parameter naming inconsistency in RequiredValidator

2. **Form validation**
   - Test all custom form validators
   - Test form field validation logic
   - Test form clean methods and cross-field validation

3. **Core utilities**
   - Test helper functions
   - Test data processing utilities

4. **Product validation** ✅ *Implemented*
   - ✅ Created isolated product validation tests without Django dependencies
   - ✅ Implemented tests for SKU uniqueness validation
   - ✅ Implemented tests for parent-variant relationship validation
   - ✅ Implemented tests for price validation
   - ✅ Implemented tests for category code uniqueness
   - ✅ Implemented tests for image validation

### Phase 2: Business Logic (Weeks 3-4)

1. **Product module business logic**
   - Test product creation/update workflows
   - Test pricing calculation
   - Test availability logic

2. **Inventory logic**
   - Test stock management
   - Test reservation system
   - Test allocation logic

3. **Sales logic**
   - Test order processing
   - Test discount application
   - Test tax calculation

### Phase 3: Integration Points (Weeks 5-6)

1. **Legacy sync modules**
   - Test data import/export
   - Test synchronization logic
   - Test error handling and recovery

2. **API endpoints**
   - Test authentication and authorization
   - Test request validation
   - Test response formatting
   - Test error handling

3. **Management commands**
   - Test command execution
   - Test parameter validation
   - Test output formatting

## 3. Test Implementation Best Practices

### Mocking Strategy

1. **Database Access**
   - Mock the Django ORM for unit tests
   - Use in-memory SQLite for integration tests

2. **External Services**
   - Mock all API calls to external services
   - Create consistent response fixtures

3. **File System**
   - Mock file system access for predictable test behavior

### Test Organization

1. **Test Location**
   - Place tests in the `tests/unit/` directory for unit tests
   - Place tests in the `tests/integration/` directory for integration tests
   - Place tests in the `tests/e2e/` directory for end-to-end tests

2. **Naming Convention**
   - Name test files `test_<module_name>.py`
   - Name test classes `Test<ClassBeingTested>`
   - Name test methods `test_<behavior_being_tested>`

3. **Test Structure**
   - Use pytest fixtures for test setup
   - Group related tests into test classes
   - Use descriptive docstrings for each test

### Test Coverage Goals

1. **Short-term Goal** (1 month)
   - Increase overall coverage to 30%
   - Focus on critical business logic

2. **Medium-term Goal** (3 months)
   - Increase overall coverage to 60%
   - Cover all public APIs and business logic

3. **Long-term Goal** (6 months)
   - Maintain coverage above 80%
   - Cover all code paths and edge cases

## 4. Implementation Plan

| Complete validator tests | 95% | pyerp/core/validators.py | In Progress |
| Add form validation tests | 80% | pyerp/core/forms.py | Planned |
| Add utility function tests | 80% | pyerp/core/utils.py | Planned |
| Create product validation tests | 100% | tests/unit/test_product_validation.py | ✅ Completed |

### Week 3-4: Business Logic

| Task | Target Coverage | Files |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Product module tests | 80% | pyerp/products/*.py |
| Inventory logic tests | 70% | pyerp/inventory/*.py |
| Sales logic tests | 70% | pyerp/sales/*.py |

### Week 5-6: Integration Points

| Task | Target Coverage | Files |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Legacy sync module tests | 60% | pyerp/legacy_sync/*.py |
| API endpoint tests | 80% | pyerp/*/api.py |
| Management command tests | 70% | pyerp/management/commands/*.py |

## 5. Tools and Resources

1. **Coverage Analysis**
   - Use the `find_low_coverage.py` script to identify modules with low coverage
   - Run with: `python tests/find_low_coverage.py`

2. **Test Templates**
   - Use the `test_template.py` file in the `tests/unit/` directory as a reference

3. **Test Configuration**
   - Update `conftest.py` for test setup requirements
   - Add fixtures for common test scenarios

4. **Running Tests**
   - Use the run_tests.py script to run individual test modules

## 6. Monitoring Progress

1. **Weekly Coverage Reports**
   - Generate coverage reports weekly
   - Track progress against goals

2. **Code Review**
   - Include coverage reports in code reviews
   - Require tests for all new features

3. **Continuous Integration**
   - Run tests and coverage analysis in CI pipeline
   - Fail the build if coverage decreases significantly
