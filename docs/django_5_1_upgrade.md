- More efficient template rendering

### Security Improvements

- Updated security practices and libraries
- Removal of deprecated hashers (SHA1, UnsaltedSHA1, UnsaltedMD5)

  - Improved fieldset collapsible sections with `<details>` and `<summary>` tags
- Better screen reader compatibility

### Features We Can Leverage

#### Admin Interface Improvements

- Better responsive design

- Improved testing framework

## Changes Required for Our Code

- Updated `RemovedInDjango60Warning` in pytest settings
- Verified compatibility with all Django 5.1 changes
- Ensured all third-party packages are compatible

## Removed Features

The following features were removed in Django 5.1 and should not be used:

- `BaseUserManager.make_random_password()` method

## Next Steps

1. Leverage new Django 5.1 features in upcoming development
2. Consider updating frontend code to take advantage of the improved admin interface
3. Review error handling and logging to use improved mechanisms
4. Update developer documentation with new best practices
