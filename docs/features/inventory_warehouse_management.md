# Story: PYERP-INVENTORY - Inventory and Warehouse Management Module

## Description
As an inventory manager
I want to track products across warehouse storage locations using a box and slot system
So that I can efficiently manage inventory, locate products, and optimize warehouse space

## Background
The current legacy ERP system has a basic inventory system (Stamm_Lagerorte table) with location data but lacks the flexibility and features needed for modern warehouse management. We need to create an improved inventory management system that:

1. Syncs with legacy data but enhances the data model
2. Organizes products into boxes with multiple slots
3. Places boxes in storage locations (unit/compartment/shelf)
4. Provides better tracking and management capabilities
5. Supports inventory reservations
6. Facilitates picking for orders

Legacy data in Stamm_Lagerorte includes: Country, city_building, sale (if products in this spot are sold), special spot, unit, compartment, shelf.

The current structure is somewhat messy, and we need to improve it while maintaining the ability to sync with the old system.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Given I need to migrate data from the legacy system
   When I run the synchronization process
   Then the data from Stamm_Lagerorte should be properly imported into the new data structure

2. Given I am managing inventory
   When I need to place a product in storage
   Then I should be able to assign it to a box slot and track its location

3. Given I am managing storage locations
   When I view a storage location
   Then I should see all boxes stored there with their contents

4. Given I am searching for a product
   When I query the system
   Then I should be able to find all storage locations where the product is stored

5. Given I am managing boxes
   When I move a box to a new storage location
   Then all product slots in that box should be updated to reflect the new location

6. Given I am processing an order
   When I need to pick items
   Then I should be able to view a picking list showing location information

7. Given I am planning future orders
   When I need to allocate inventory
   Then I should be able to reserve products for specific purposes

8. Given I am tracking inventory
   When products move in or out of the warehouse
   Then the system should record these movements with appropriate reference information

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Create data models for:
  - StorageLocation (country, city_building, unit, compartment, shelf, sale, special_spot, etc.)
  - BoxType (dimensions, weight capacity, slot count, slot naming scheme)
  - Box (box type, code, storage location, status)
  - BoxSlot (box, slot code, barcode, occupied status)
  - ProductStorage (product, box slot, quantity, reservation status)
  - InventoryMovement (product, from/to slots, quantity, movement type)

- [ ] Implement synchronization with legacy Stamm_Lagerorte data
  - Create extractor for Stamm_Lagerorte table
  - Develop transformer to map legacy fields to new model
  - Build loader to handle updates and conflict resolution

- [ ] Create APIs for managing inventory:
  - Storage location management
  - Box and slot operations
  - Product placement and removal
  - Inventory movements and reservations
  - Picking list generation

- [ ] Design UI components for:
  - Storage location browsing/management
  - Box management with slot visualization
  - Product placement interface
  - Movement recording
  - Picking list view
  - Inventory reports

- [ ] Integration with other modules:
  - Products module for product information
  - Sales module for order fulfillment and picking
  - Production module for raw material consumption

## Test Scenarios
1. Data Synchronization
   - Setup: Configure test environment with mock legacy data
   - Steps: Run synchronization process
   - Expected: New data structure should be populated with legacy data

2. Product Placement
   - Setup: Create test storage locations, boxes, and products
   - Steps: Assign products to box slots
   - Expected: Products should be correctly associated with slots and locations

3. Box Movement
   - Setup: Create test storage locations, boxes with products
   - Steps: Move a box to a different storage location
   - Expected: All product slots should update to the new location

4. Inventory Reservation
   - Setup: Create test products in storage
   - Steps: Reserve inventory for an order
   - Expected: Reserved inventory should be marked and not available for other orders

5. Picking Process
   - Setup: Create test order with multiple products
   - Steps: Generate picking list and complete picking
   - Expected: Inventory should be updated and movements recorded

## Dependencies
- [ ] Access to legacy Stamm_Lagerorte table
- [ ] Product module
- [ ] User authentication and permissions module
- [ ] Sales module for order integration
- [ ] Production module for materials management

## Estimation
- Story Points: 21
- Time Estimate: 3 weeks
