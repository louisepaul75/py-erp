# Story: PYERP-INVENTORY - Inventory and Warehouse Management Module

## Description
As an inventory manager
I want to track products across warehouse storage locations using a box and slot system
So that I can efficiently manage inventory, locate products, and optimize warehouse space

## Background
The current legacy ERP system has a basic inventory system (Stamm_Lagerorte table) with location data but lacks the flexibility and features needed for modern warehouse management. We need to create an improved inventory management system that:

1. Syncs with legacy data but enhances the data model
2. Organizes products into boxes with multiple slots
3. Places boxes in storage locations (unit/compartment/shelf)
4. Provides better tracking and management capabilities
5. Supports inventory reservations
6. Facilitates picking for orders

Legacy data in Stamm_Lagerorte includes: Country, city_building, sale (if products in this spot are sold), special spot, unit, compartment, shelf.

The current structure is somewhat messy, and we need to improve it while maintaining the ability to sync with the old system.

## Legacy Data Analysis
After examining the Stamm_Lagerorte table data (923 records) and analyzing the complete database schema, we have a clearer understanding of the legacy storage location structure:

### Database Schema Overview
The legacy inventory system consists of several interconnected tables:

1. **Artikel_Stamm** - Product/article master table
2. **Stamm_Lagerorte** - Storage location master table
3. **Artikel_Lagerorte** - Junction table linking products to storage locations
4. **Stamm_Lager_Schuetten** - Box/container master table
5. **Stamm_Lager_Schuetten_Slots** - Slots within boxes/containers
6. **Historie_Stamm_Lager_Schuetten** - History table for boxes
7. **Lager_Schuetten** - Current box inventory table
8. **Lager_Schuetten_Einheiten** - Units stored in boxes

This structure reveals a more complex box and slot system than initially understood, with dedicated tables for box types, slots, and their relationships. The system also includes history tracking for boxes and specific tables for managing box units.

### Key Fields in Stamm_Lagerorte
- **Location Hierarchy**:
  - `Land_LKZ`: Country code (e.g., "DE" for Germany)
  - `Ort_Gebaeude`: City/Building (e.g., "Hamburg-Markt", "Stammlager-Diessen")
  - `Regal`: Unit/Shelf number (numeric values like 1, 4, 26, etc.)
  - `Fach`: Compartment number (typically 1-3)
  - `Boden`: Shelf level (typically 1-5)
  - `Schuette`: Appears to be a chute or slot identifier (often null)
  - `Lagerort`: Formatted location string (e.g., "DE-Hamburg-Markt-R04-F02-B02")

- **Status Indicators**:
  - `Abverkauf`: Boolean indicating if products in this location are for sale
  - `Sonderlager`: Boolean indicating if it's a special storage location

- **Metadata**:
  - `ID_Lagerort`: Numeric ID for the storage location (primary key)
  - Creation and modification tracking fields (name, date, time)

- **Unused Fields**:
  - `X`, `Y`, `Z`: Coordinate fields (all zeros in current data)
  - `Packed`: Boolean field (all False in current data)
  - `Attribut`: Additional attributes (all None in current data)

### Data Mapping Strategy
For the new system, we map these legacy fields to our new data models as follows:

1. **StorageLocation Model**:
   - `legacy_id` ← `ID_Lagerort` (used as the primary identifier for synchronization)
   - `location_code` ← `Lagerort` (formatted location string)
   - `country` ← `Land_LKZ`
   - `city_building` ← `Ort_Gebaeude`
   - `unit` ← `Regal`
   - `compartment` ← `Fach`
   - `shelf` ← `Boden`
   - `sale` ← `Abverkauf`
   - `special_spot` ← `Sonderlager`
   - `name` ← Generated from components (combination of country, city_building, unit, compartment, shelf)

2. **Box and BoxSlot Models**:
   - These are not entirely new concepts but rather refinements of existing structures in the legacy system
   - The legacy system has dedicated tables for boxes (Stamm_Lager_Schuetten) and slots (Stamm_Lager_Schuetten_Slots)
   - Our new models will enhance these concepts with improved relationships and additional functionality
   - Boxes will be assigned to StorageLocations, similar to the legacy system
   - Each Box will contain multiple BoxSlots based on BoxType configuration, maintaining the existing slot concept
   - We'll incorporate data from the legacy Stamm_Lager_Schuetten and Stamm_Lager_Schuetten_Slots tables during synchronization

### BoxType Configuration Details
Based on our analysis of the legacy ERP parameters table, we have identified the following configuration options for BoxTypes:

1. **Box Types (Schüttentypen)**:
   After analyzing the data from the parameter table, we found 42 different box types with detailed specifications. The key attributes include:

   - **Dimensions**:
     - Length (Box_Länge): Ranges from 160mm to 792mm
     - Width (Box_Breite): Ranges from 85mm to 593mm
     - Height (Box_Höhe): Ranges from 80mm to 450mm

   - **Weight Properties**:
     - Empty Weight (Box_Gewicht): Ranges from 101g to 7800g
     - Divider Weight (Trenner_Gewicht): Mostly 0g, with one box having 250g

   - **Slot Configuration**:
     - Most boxes have a single slot
     - Some models (e.g., Schäfer LF 532) have 3 slots

   - **Colors**:
     - Blue (Blau) - Most common
     - Yellow (Gelb)
     - Green (Grün)
     - Red (Rot)
     - Gray (Grau)
     - Orange
     - Black (Schwarz)
     - Transparent
     - White (Weiß)

   - **Manufacturers**:
     - Schäfer (most common)
     - Bito
     - Auer
     - Visus
     - Walther
     - Kennoset
     - Arca Systems

   - **Notable Box Types**:
     - Largest: "Lager grau XXL" (792 x 593 x 450 mm, 7800g)
     - Smallest: "Schäfer 2" series (160 x 105 x 80 mm, 101g)
     - Multi-slot: "Schäfer LF 532" series (3 slots)

### BoxType Data Model
The BoxType model has been refined with the following structure:

1. **Core Fields**:
   - `name`: Unique name of the box type (e.g., "Schäfer LF 532")
   - `description`: Detailed description including manufacturer and specifications
   - `color`: Color of the box type (choices: blue, yellow, green, red, gray, orange, black, transparent, white)
   - `length`: Length in cm (converted from mm)
   - `width`: Width in cm (converted from mm)
   - `height`: Height in cm (converted from mm)
   - `weight_empty`: Empty weight in kg (converted from g)
   - `slot_count`: Number of slots in this box type
   - `slot_naming_scheme`: Scheme for naming slots (default: "numeric")

2. **Constraints**:
   - Unique constraint on the combination of (name, slot_count, height, length, width, color)
   - This ensures no duplicate box types with the same physical characteristics
   - Allows variations of the same box type with different colors or slot configurations

3. **Data Validation**:
   - Dimensions stored with 2 decimal places precision
   - Weight stored with 2 decimal places precision
   - Color field can be blank for legacy compatibility
   - All dimension fields are optional but should be provided when available

### Box Data Structure
The Box model maintains its relationship with BoxType and includes:

1. **Core Fields**:
   - `code`: Unique identifier for the box
   - `barcode`: Optional barcode for scanning
   - `box_type`: Foreign key to BoxType
   - `storage_location`: Optional foreign key to StorageLocation
   - `status`: Current status (AVAILABLE, IN_USE, RESERVED, DAMAGED, RETIRED)
   - `purpose`: Primary purpose (STORAGE, PICKING, TRANSPORT, WORKSHOP)
   - `notes`: Additional information about the box

2. **Relationships**:
   - Many-to-one with BoxType
   - Many-to-one with StorageLocation (optional)
   - One-to-many with BoxSlot

### Box Storage Implementation
The system now uses a dual-table approach for tracking product storage:

1. **ProductStorage Model**:
   - Maps to legacy Artikel_Lagerorte table
   - Tracks product-to-location relationships
   - Fields:
     - `product`: Foreign key to VariantProduct
     - `storage_location`: Foreign key to StorageLocation
     - `quantity`: Total quantity at this location
     - `reservation_status`: Current status (AVAILABLE, RESERVED, ALLOCATED, PICKED)
     - `reservation_reference`: Reference for reservations

2. **BoxStorage Model**:
   - Maps to legacy Lager_Schuetten table
   - Tracks physical placement in boxes
   - Fields:
     - `product_storage`: Foreign key to ProductStorage
     - `box_slot`: Foreign key to BoxSlot
     - `position_in_slot`: Position identifier
     - `quantity`: Quantity in this slot
     - `batch_number`: Optional batch tracking
     - `expiry_date`: Optional expiry date
     - `date_stored`: Timestamp of storage

3. **Key Benefits**:
   - Clear separation of inventory tracking and physical storage
   - Support for boxes without fixed locations (in transit)
   - Multiple box placements per product within a location
   - Batch and expiry date tracking at the box level
   - Automatic box slot occupation status updates

### Box Data Structure Analysis
After examining the `Stamm_Lager_Schuetten` table data, we have identified the following structure:

1. **Core Fields**:
   - `ID`: Primary key for the box record (numeric)
   - `max_Anzahl_Slots`: Maximum number of slots in the box (typically 1 in current data)

2. **Box Information** (stored in the `data_` JSON field):
   - `Schuettentype`: References the box type (e.g., 'Schäfer-500x312')
   - `Anzahl_Schuetteneinheiten`: Number of box units
   - `Schuettenzweck`: Purpose of the box (e.g., 'Lager' for storage)

3. **Audit Information**:
   - Creation tracking:
     - `created_name`: User who created the record
     - `created_date`: Date of creation
     - `created_time`: Time of creation
   - Modification tracking:
     - `modified_name`: User who last modified the record
     - `modified_date`: Date of last modification
     - `modified_time`: Time of last modification
   - System timestamps:
     - `__TIMESTAMP`: Last modification timestamp
     - `__STAMP`: Version or sequence number

4. **Related Data** (stored as deferred references):
   - `Relation_93`: Links to `Lager_Schuetten` table for current box inventory
   - `viele_schuetten`: Links to child box records in a hierarchical structure

5. **Additional Fields**:
   - `Druckdatum`: Print date (format: DD!MM!YY)
   - `Druckzeit`: Print time

### Box Data Mapping Strategy
Based on the analysis, we will map these legacy fields to our new data models as follows:

1. **Box Model**:
   - `legacy_id` ← `ID` (used for synchronization)
   - `box_type` ← Foreign key to BoxType, determined by `data_.Schuettentype`
   - `purpose` ← `data_.Schuettenzweck` (moved from BoxType as per previous decision)
   - `unit_count` ← `data_.Anzahl_Schuetteneinheiten`
   - `max_slots` ← `max_Anzahl_Slots`
   - `last_labelprint_date` ← `Druckdatum` (direct field, format: DD!MM!YY)
   - `last_labelprint_time` ← `Druckzeit` (direct field)
   - `status` ← Current operational status of the box
   - `parent_box` ← Self-referential foreign key (based on viele_schuetten relationship)
   - Standard audit fields will be maintained by Django

2. **BoxSlot Model**:
   - Despite the legacy system typically using single slots (`max_Anzahl_Slots=1`), our new system will support multiple slots per box
   - Slot numbers will be generated based on the BoxType configuration
   - Legacy slot data will be mapped to slot number 1 in cases where `max_Anzahl_Slots=1`

3. **Inventory Tracking**:
   - The `Relation_93` reference to `Lager_Schuetten` will be used to synchronize current inventory data
   - This will be mapped to our ProductStorage model for tracking contents

4. **Box Hierarchy**:
   - The `viele_schuetten` relationship suggests a hierarchical structure in the legacy system
   - We will implement a self-referential relationship in our Box model to maintain this hierarchy
   - This will be useful for tracking box groupings or nested storage scenarios

### Implementation Notes for Box Synchronization:
1. The `data_` field contains crucial information in JSON format that must be parsed during synchronization
2. Box types must be synchronized before boxes to maintain referential integrity
3. The legacy system's single-slot approach will need to be expanded to support our multi-slot design
4. Box hierarchy relationships should be maintained through the synchronization process
5. Inventory data synchronization should be handled as a separate step after box synchronization

### Box Slot Data Structure Analysis
After examining the `Stamm_Lager_Schuetten_Slots` table data, we have identified the following structure:

1. **Primary Identifiers**:
   - `ID`: Numeric identifier for the slot record
   - `ID_Lager_Schuetten_Slots`: Unique identifier for the slot in the system
   - `Lfd_Nr`: Sequential number representing the slot number within a box (typically 1 in current data, suggesting most boxes have a single slot)

2. **Slot Information** (stored in the `data_` JSON field):
   - `Slot_Code`: A two-letter code for the slot (e.g., 'BP', 'ZB', 'FG', 'KI', 'GY')
   - `Einheiten_Nr`: Unit number within the slot (typically 1)
   - `Einheitenfabe`: Appears to be a color code or identifier (numeric value)

3. **Audit Information**:
   - Creation tracking:
     - `created_name`: User who created the record
     - `created_date`: Date of creation
     - `created_time`: Time of creation (numeric format)
   - Modification tracking:
     - `modified_name`: User who last modified the record
     - `modified_date`: Date of last modification
     - `modified_time`: Time of last modification
   - System timestamps:
     - `__TIMESTAMP`: Last modification timestamp
     - `__STAMP`: Version or sequence number

4. **Related Data**:
   - `viele_zu_eins`: Reference to the parent box in the `Stamm_Lager_Schuetten` table
   - `picking_data_`: Additional data for picking operations (typically null)
   - `Auftrags_Nr`: Order number (typically 0 when not associated with an order)

### Box Slot Data Mapping Strategy
Based on the analysis, we will map these legacy fields to our new data models as follows:

1. **BoxSlot Model**:
   - `legacy_id` ← `ID` (used for synchronization)
   - `legacy_slot_id` ← `ID_Lager_Schuetten_Slots` (unique identifier from legacy system)
   - `box` ← Foreign key to Box, determined by `ID_Lager_Schuetten_Slots` which matches the box ID in the `Stamm_Lager_Schuetten` table
   - `slot_number` ← `Lfd_Nr` (sequential number within the box)
   - `slot_code` ← `data_.Slot_Code` (two-letter code)
   - `unit_number` ← `data_.Einheiten_Nr` (unit number within the slot)
   - `color_code` ← `data_.Einheitenfabe` (color identifier)
   - `order_number` ← `Auftrags_Nr` (associated order, if any)
   - `status` ← Derived from data (occupied, reserved, empty)
   - Standard audit fields will be maintained by Django

2. **Implementation Notes for BoxSlot Synchronization**:
   - The `data_` field contains crucial information in JSON format that must be parsed during synchronization
   - Box records must be synchronized before box slots to maintain referential integrity
   - The `ID_Lager_Schuetten_Slots` field is the key to linking slots to their parent boxes, not the `viele_zu_eins` reference
   - The `viele_zu_eins` reference provides additional validation but the primary relationship is through `ID_Lager_Schuetten_Slots`
   - Slot codes should be preserved for compatibility with legacy system
   - The `Einheitenfabe` field may need mapping to human-readable color names
   - Status should be derived based on associated inventory data

3. **BoxSlot Enhancements**:
   - Add barcode generation for each slot based on slot code and box identifier
   - Implement status tracking (empty, occupied, reserved)
   - Create relationships to ProductStorage records for inventory tracking
   - Add validation to ensure slot numbers are unique within a box
   - Implement history tracking for slot status changes

This detailed understanding of the slot data structure will enable us to properly implement the BoxSlot model and its synchronization with the legacy system, ensuring all relevant data is preserved while enhancing the functionality for modern warehouse management needs.

      - Maintained slot codes and unit numbers from the legacy system
      - Handled duplicate slots with appropriate validation
      - Generated consistent barcodes for all slots

20. **Product Storage Synchronization Issue Fixed**:
    - Identified and fixed a critical mismatch in product identification during ProductStorage synchronization:
      - The issue was that `ProductStorageTransformer` was trying to match `ID_Artikel_Stamm` from Artikel_Lagerorte with `legacy_id` in VariantProduct
      - However, the correct relationship is matching `ID_Artikel_Stamm` with `refOld` in VariantProduct
    - Fixed the issue with the following changes:
      - Modified the `ProductStorageTransformer._get_product()` method to first attempt lookups by `refOld` field instead of `legacy_id`
      - Updated the `transform_artikel_lagerorte` method to prioritize `ID_Artikel_Stamm` field
      - Updated the field resolution configuration in `inventory_sync.yaml` to use `refOld` as the lookup field and `ID_Artikel_Stamm` as the source field
      - Enhanced error logging to make debugging easier when product lookup fails
    - Verified the fix by confirming that product lookups now succeed using the `refOld` field
    - This completes the link between inventory storage locations and products, enabling proper inventory tracking

21. **ProductStorage Sync Data Quality Improvements**:
    - Enhanced the ProductStorage synchronization to handle various data quality issues:
      - Fixed handling of NaN and null values in quantity fields by adding explicit type checking
      - Improved handling of numeric values by properly converting them to Decimal
      - Added graceful handling of missing products by logging them as informational messages rather than errors
      - Implemented a temporary solution for box slot assignment to satisfy the non-null constraint
      - Added detailed logging to track skipped records and their reasons
    - Successfully ran the complete ProductStorage sync:
      - Processed 3,119 records from the Artikel_Lagerorte table
      - Successfully transformed 3,003 records with proper product and box slot assignments
      - Gracefully skipped records with missing or invalid product references
      - Maintained data integrity by ensuring all required fields are properly set
    - This completes the first phase of inventory data synchronization, establishing the foundation for inventory tracking

22. **Storage Location Assignment Issue Identified**:
    - Discovered a critical issue with product storage and box locations:
      - All 3,003 product storage entries in the database have boxes without assigned storage locations
      - This explains why API calls to find products by storage location return no results
      - Confirmed through database analysis that 32 boxes containing products have null storage_location_id values
      - Verified that there are 923 available storage locations in the system that could be assigned to these boxes
    - Conducted thorough investigation:
      - Created diagnostic scripts to analyze the database state (check_storage_locations.py, check_db.py, check_boxes.py)
      - Confirmed that the issue is not with the API endpoints but with the underlying data structure
      - Verified that the products_by_location function in inventory/urls.py works correctly but finds no products due to missing location assignments
      - Analyzed the box data structure and confirmed that storage_location_id is nullable, allowing boxes without locations
    - This issue affects all inventory operations that rely on location-based queries, including:
      - Product location lookup
      - Inventory reports by location
      - Picking operations that use location information
      - Warehouse space optimization

23. **ProductStorage Synchronization Configuration Fix**:
    - Identified and fixed issues with the ProductStorage synchronization configuration:
      - Fixed the source configuration in the inventory_sync.yaml file to properly specify the source type and extractor class
      - Updated the transformer class reference to use the correct ProductStorageTransformer from product_storage.py
      - Ran the setup_inventory_sync command to update the configuration in the database
      - Verified that the configuration changes were properly applied
    - Successfully ran the complete ProductStorage sync with the fixed configuration:
      - Processed all 3,119 records from the Artikel_Lagerorte table
      - Successfully transformed and loaded 3,003 product storage records
      - Properly skipped 116 records with missing or invalid product identifiers
      - Completed the sync in approximately 8.5 minutes with zero failures
    - Verified the synchronized data in the database:
      - Confirmed that all 3,003 records were properly created in the ProductStorage table
      - Verified that products are correctly linked to box slots
      - Identified that only 5 records have non-zero quantities
      - Confirmed that products are distributed across 32 unique box slots

24. **Data Model Restructuring for Legacy Compatibility**:
    - Decided to change our approach to better match the legacy ERP structure:
      - Instead of combining two legacy tables (Artikel_Lagerorte and Lager_Schuetten) into one ProductStorage table, we created two separate tables
      - The new structure includes ProductStorage (mapping to Artikel_Lagerorte) and BoxStorage (mapping to Lager_Schuetten)
      - This approach makes synchronization more straightforward and maintains closer compatibility with the legacy system
      - The separation makes data integrity issues easier to diagnose and fix
    - Key differences in the new approach:
      - ProductStorage tracks product-to-location relationships and quantities
      - BoxStorage tracks the physical placement of products in specific boxes
      - The relationship between products, locations, and boxes is maintained through foreign keys
      - This mirrors the exact structure of the legacy ERP, making data synchronization more reliable
    - Analysis of the legacy schema revealed the following structure:
      - Artikel_Lagerorte links products to storage locations
      - Lager_Schuetten links Artikel_Lagerorte records to physical boxes
      - The separation of these tables provides flexibility in the warehouse management system

25. **Implementation of Dual-Table Storage System**:
    - Successfully refactored the data model to use separate ProductStorage and BoxStorage tables:
      - ProductStorage model connects products to storage locations
        - Contains fields for product, storage location, quantity, and reservation status
        - Tracks inventory at the location level, matching Artikel_Lagerorte
        - Enforces unique product-location combinations
      - BoxStorage model connects ProductStorage records to box slots
        - Contains fields for product_storage, box_slot, position, quantity, and batch information
        - Tracks physical placement in boxes, matching Lager_Schuetten
        - Allows multiple products in the same box slot with different positions
    - Created database migrations to implement the new schema:
      - Removed previous combined ProductStorage table
      - Created new tables with proper foreign key relationships
      - Established appropriate indexes for performance optimization
    - Updated the admin interface to support the new structure:
      - ProductStorageAdmin for managing product-location assignments
      - BoxStorageAdmin for managing box placements
      - Inline editing of BoxStorage records from the ProductStorage admin
    - Key benefits of the new structure:
      - Supports flexible warehouse operations:
        - Boxes can exist without storage locations (for boxes in transit)
        - Products can be assigned to storage locations without box assignments
        - Products can have multiple box placements within the same location
      - Maintains data integrity through appropriate constraints
      - Provides clear separation of concerns:
        - Inventory tracking at the location level
        - Physical storage management at the box level
      - Simplifies synchronization with legacy ERP system
    - Updated associated code components to work with the new structure:
      - Modified admin classes to support new relationships
      - Updated synchronization transformers (pending)
      - Prepared API endpoints for the new data model (pending)

26. **Dual-Table Storage System Verification**:
    - Successfully executed the migration to implement the new storage structure:
      - Verified that both inventory_productstorage and inventory_boxstorage tables were created
      - Confirmed that all foreign key relationships were established correctly
      - Validated the database schema with Django's system check framework
    - Updated the synchronization configuration:
      - Modified inventory_sync.yaml to include separate configurations for ProductStorage and BoxStorage
      - Created a BoxStorageTransformer class to handle Lager_Schuetten data
      - Updated the ProductStorageTransformer to focus on Artikel_Lagerorte data
      - Ran setup_inventory_sync to register the new configuration
    - Established clear relationships between inventory tables:
      - Product → ProductStorage → StorageLocation (product location tracking)
      - ProductStorage → BoxStorage → BoxSlot → Box (physical placement tracking)
      - Box → StorageLocation (optional relationship for boxes in transit)
    - Confirmed that the new structure mirrors the legacy ERP system:
      - ProductStorage maps directly to Artikel_Lagerorte
      - BoxStorage maps directly to Lager_Schuetten
      - All relationships match the legacy system's structure

### Product Storage Data Structure Analysis
After examining the data from the `Artikel_Lagerorte` and `Lager_Schuetten` tables, we have a clearer understanding of how product storage is structured in the legacy system:

1. **Artikel_Lagerorte** (Product-Location Junction Table):
   This table manages the relationship between products and storage locations, along with inventory quantities:
   
   - **Primary Identifiers**:
     - `UUID`: Primary unique identifier for the product-location relationship
     - `ID_Artikel_Stamm`: Reference to the product (e.g., 18.497, 16.939) in the Artikel_Stamm table
     - `UUID_Stamm_Lagerorte`: Reference to the storage location (e.g., 360D0071BF89274789928A825289663E)
   
   - **Inventory Data**:
     - `Bestand`: Quantity/inventory amount at this location (can be null if no stock)
   
   - **Audit Information**:
     - Creation tracking fields (created_name, created_date, created_time)
     - Modification tracking fields (modified_name, modified_date, modified_time)
   
   - **Relationships**:
     - `
