# Product Module Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation progress of the Products module in the pyERP system. The Products module is a core component that manages product data, including parent-variant relationships, image integration, and data import from legacy systems.

## Implementation Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Data Models | âœ… Implemented | BaseProduct, ParentProduct, VariantProduct, ProductImage, ImageSyncLog |
| Legacy Data Import | âœ… Implemented | Parent and variant import from 4D system |
| Image Integration | âœ… Implemented | Integration with external image database API |
| Admin Interface | âœ… Implemented | Customized admin for parent and variant products |
| REST API | âœ… Partially Implemented | Basic endpoints available, advanced filtering planned |
| Frontend Views | âœ… Partially Implemented | List and detail views implemented, advanced features in progress |
| Category Management | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Basic structure implemented, hierarchy management planned |

## Model Architecture

The product module uses a split model approach with:

1. **BaseProduct**: Abstract base class with common fields
2. **ParentProduct**: Model for product families
3. **VariantProduct**: Model for specific product variants
4. **Product**: Legacy model maintained for backward compatibility
5. **ProductImage**: Model for caching external image data

This architecture provides a clear separation of concerns and better supports the parent-variant relationship structure of the product catalog.

## Data Import Progress

### Parent Products Import
- Total parent products imported: 1,571
- Import source: Artikel_Familie table in 4D system
- Management command: `import_artikel_familie.py`
- Status: âœ… Complete

### Variant Products Import
- Total variant products imported: 4,078
- Import source: Artikel_Variante table in 4D system
- Management command: `import_artikel_variante.py`
- Status: âœ… Complete

### Relationship Management
- Parent-child relationships established: 4,078 variants linked to parents
- Management command: `link_variants_to_existing_parents.py`
- Status: âœ… Complete

## Image Integration Progress

The product module integrates with an external image database through an API:

- API Endpoint: `http://webapp.zinnfiguren.de/api/all-files-and-articles/`
- Image types supported: Produktfoto, Markt-Messe-Shop, Szene, Illustration, etc.
- Prioritization logic: Produktfoto + front=true > Produktfoto > front=true > other
- Format preferences: PNG > JPEG > original format
- Resolution support: From thumbnails (200Ã—200) to full size (4032Ã—3024)

### Image Sync
- Implemented sync management command: `sync_product_images.py`
- Tracking of sync operations via ImageSyncLog model
- Caching of image metadata to improve performance
- Parent-variant aware image matching

## API Endpoints

The product module exposes the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/products/`: List all products with filtering and pagination
- `GET /api/products/categories/`: List all product categories
- `GET /api/products/<id>/`: Get details for a specific product
- `GET /api/products/by-slug/<slug>/`: Get product details by slug
- `GET /api/products/variant/<id>/`: Get details for a specific variant

## Frontend Integration

The product module includes Vue.js components for the frontend:

- `ProductList.vue`: List view with filtering and pagination
- `ProductDetail.vue`: Detail view with images and variant selection
- `VariantDetail.vue`: Variant detail view with related variants

### Asset Handling

The frontend now includes centralized utilities for handling static assets:

- `assetUtils.ts`: Utility functions for static asset URL management
  - `getStaticAssetUrl()`: Retrieves correct URLs for static assets
  - `getNoImageUrl()`: Provides the no-image placeholder URL
  - `getValidImageUrl()`: Validates image URLs and provides fallbacks
  - `handleImageError()`: Manages image loading errors

These utilities ensure consistent image handling across all product views and provide robust fallback mechanisms for missing images. The system automatically determines the appropriate base URL based on the deployment environment (localhost, specific IP, production).

## Management Commands

The product module includes the following management commands:

### Import Commands
- `import_artikel_familie.py`: Import parent products
- `import_artikel_variante.py`: Import variant products
- `link_variants_to_existing_parents.py`: Link variants to parents

### Relationship Management
- `fix_variant_parent_relationships.py`: Fix incorrect relationships
- `fix_missing_variants.py`: Handle orphaned variants
- `create_placeholder_parents.py`: Create placeholder parents

### Image Management
- `sync_product_images.py`: Synchronize with external image database

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **Category Management**: The hierarchical category management is still in development.
2. **Advanced API Filtering**: More advanced filtering options for the API are planned.
3. **Bulk Operations**: Bulk update and delete operations are not yet implemented.
4. **Documentation**: API documentation needs to be enhanced.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the category management implementation
2. Enhance API with advanced filtering options
3. Add bulk operations for product management
4. Improve documentation for API endpoints
5. Implement more comprehensive validation rules
6. Add integration tests for the complete module

## Conclusion

The product module has made significant progress with the implementation of parent-variant models, image integration, and data import from legacy systems. The remaining tasks focus on enhancing the user experience, improving API functionality, and completing the category management implementation.
