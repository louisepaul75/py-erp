# Frontend Asset Handling Improvements

**Date:** June 15, 2025

## Overview

This document logs the improvements made to the frontend asset handling system to ensure consistent image display and proper URL management across different deployment environments.

## Enhancements

### 1. Centralized Asset Utilities

Created a new utility file `frontend/src/utils/assetUtils.ts` with the following functions:

- **`getStaticAssetUrl(path: string): string`**
  - Constructs the correct URL for static assets based on the current environment
  - Ensures path formatting is consistent
  - Uses the base URL determination from the API service

- **`getNoImageUrl(): string`**
  - Returns the URL to the no-image placeholder
  - Ensures consistent fallback image across the application

- **`getValidImageUrl(imageObj?: { url?: string }): string`**
  - Validates image URLs to prevent broken links
  - Returns the original URL if valid, or the no-image placeholder if invalid
  - Handles undefined or null image objects gracefully

- **`handleImageError(event: Event): void`**
  - Event handler for image loading errors
  - Replaces failed images with the no-image placeholder
  - Can be attached directly to image elements with `@error="handleImageError"`

### 2. Environment-Aware Base URL Determination

Enhanced the API service with a `determineBaseUrl()` function that:

- Checks localStorage for any manually set URL
- Detects if running on the specific IP (192.168.73.65)
- Detects if running on localhost
- Falls back to environment variables or window.location.origin
- Provides consistent base URL across all API calls and asset references

### 3. Component Integration

Updated all product-related Vue components to use the new asset utilities:

- **ProductList.vue**
  - Modified `getProductImage()` to use `getNoImageUrl()` for fallbacks
  - Added error handling with `@error="handleImageError"`

- **ProductDetail.vue**
  - Updated `getMainImage` computed property to use `getNoImageUrl()`
  - Modified `getVariantImage()` to use `getValidImageUrl()` and `getNoImageUrl()`
  - Added error handling with `@error="handleImageError"`

- **VariantDetail.vue**
  - Updated related variants section to use `getNoImageUrl()`
  - Added error handling with `@error="handleImageError"`

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: All product images now use the same fallback mechanism
- **Maintainability**: URL construction logic is centralized in one location
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling prevents broken images
- **Flexibility**: Easy adaptation to different deployment environments
- **Performance**: Reduced duplicate code and improved caching potential

## Testing

These changes were tested in multiple environments:

- Local development (localhost)
- Development server (192.168.73.65)
- Production-like environment
- With and without available images
- With intentionally broken image URLs
