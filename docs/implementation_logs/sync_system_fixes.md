# Sync System Fixes Implementation Log

**Date:** March 8, 2025
**Implementer:** Developer Team
**Status:** Completed

## Overview

This document logs the implementation of fixes and improvements to the ETL-based sync system. These changes address issues encountered during initial testing of the sync pipeline with the real legacy API. The improvements enhance compatibility with the legacy 4D system and increase the robustness of the data transformation process.

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. Record ID Length Limitation

**Issue:** The `record_id` field in the `SyncLogDetail` model was limited to 100 characters, but some legacy system IDs exceed this length.

**Solution:**
- Increased the `record_id` field length from 100 to 255 characters
- Created and applied a migration (`0002_alter_synclogdetail_record_id`)
- Updated the admin interface to properly display these longer IDs

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Before
record_id = models.CharField(max_length=100)

# After
record_id = models.CharField(max_length=255)
```

### 2. Date Filtering Field Name

**Issue:** The `LegacyAPIExtractor` was using 'Modified' as the default field name for date filtering, but the actual field in the legacy system is 'modified_date'.

**Solution:**
- Updated the default field name in the `_build_date_filter_query` method
- Made the field name configurable via mapping settings
- Added logging to track filter query construction

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Before
date_field = self.config.get('modified_date_field', 'Modified')

# After
date_field = self.config.get('modified_date_field', 'modified_date')
```

### 3. JSON Serialization Issues

**Issue:** The sync system encountered errors when trying to JSON-serialize records containing NaN values, infinity, or other non-serializable data types.

**Solution:**
- Implemented an enhanced `clean_json_data` function
- Added support for cleaning NaN, infinity, datetime objects, and numpy data types
- Applied cleaning to all records before serialization

**Code Changes:**
```python
def clean_json_data(data):
    """Clean data to ensure it can be serialized to JSON."""
    if data is None:
        return None
    
    if isinstance(data, dict):
        return {k: clean_json_data(v) for k, v in data.items()}
    
    if isinstance(data, list):
        return [clean_json_data(item) for item in data]
    
    # Convert numpy/pandas NaN, infinity to None/null
    if isinstance(data, float) and (math.isnan(data) or math.isinf(data)):
        return None
    
    # Handle numpy numeric types
    if isinstance(data, (np.integer, np.floating)):
        return data.item()
    
    # Convert datetime objects to ISO format strings
    if isinstance(data, datetime):
        return data.isoformat()
    
    return data
```

## Testing Approach

1. **Simple Connectivity Test**
   - Created `simple_sync_test.py` to verify basic API connectivity
   - Tested both direct connection and filtering capabilities
   - Verified the ability to extract data from the correct tables

2. **Full Pipeline Test**
   - Created `test_real_sync.py` to test the complete ETL pipeline
   - Configured realistic sync mapping with appropriate field settings
   - Implemented logging for each step of the process

3. **Date Filtering Test**
   - Tested incremental sync with date-based filtering
   - Verified correct filter query construction
   - Validated filter application against the legacy API

## Results and Validation

- Successfully connected to the legacy API using the correct environment
- Extracted data from the 'Artikel_Familie' table with proper pagination
- Applied date filtering using the 'modified_date' field
- Processed records with NaN values and non-serializable data types without errors
- Created and updated sync logs with extended record IDs
- Properly transformed and loaded data into the target system

## Next Steps

1. **Scheduled Execution**
   - Complete Celery worker configuration for production
   - Implement periodic tasks for regular synchronization

2. **Monitoring**
   - Enhance logging for better visibility into sync operations
   - Add alerting for failed synchronizations

3. **Additional Entity Types**
   - Apply these fixes to transformers for other entity types
   - Extend testing to cover more tables in the legacy system

## Lessons Learned

1. **Data Validation is Critical**
   - All data from external systems should be thoroughly validated and cleaned
   - JSON serialization requires special handling for non-standard data types

2. **Configurability Reduces Technical Debt**
   - Making field names and filter criteria configurable increased flexibility
   - Configuration-driven approach made fixes simpler to implement

3. **Progressive Testing**
   - Testing in small steps (connection > extraction > transformation > loading) helped isolate issues
   - Using realistic test data was essential for finding edge cases
