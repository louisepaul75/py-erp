# Product Image Synchronization Improvements

**Date:** February 28, 2025

## Overview

This document logs the improvements made to the product image synchronization system to enhance product matching and image prioritization.

## Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Product Matching Logic

The `_find_product` method in `sync_product_images.py` was improved to handle various SKU formats and better match products with images:

- **Multiple Matching Strategies:**
  - Exact match on article number (e.g. "816941")
  - Match as parent product
  - Find specific variants under parent products using variant codes
  - Prefix matching for products with internal suffixes

- **Improved Handling of Variant Codes:**
  - Now properly handles articles with suffix codes like "-BE" in the external system
  - Separates the base article number from variant codes for more accurate matching

- **Enhanced Logging:**
  - Added detailed logging for each matching attempt
  - Clear identification of when and how products are matched

### 2. Strict Image Prioritization

Updated the image selection logic in `product_filters.py` and the product views to implement a strict prioritization hierarchy:

1. Produktfoto with front=True
2. Any Produktfoto
3. Any image with front=True
4. Any image marked as primary
5. First available image

This ensures the most appropriate image is always displayed first in product listings and detail pages.

### 3. API Interaction Improvements

- Modified how articles are processed in the sync command to focus on the base article number
- Updated the product context data in views to ensure proper image selection
- Enhanced error handling for API requests

## Testing

These changes were tested with specific SKUs known to have different image types:

- SKU "816941" (Anglerhase) - Confirmed proper handling with multiple image types
- Products with variant codes - Verified matching works with different SKU formats

## Benefits

- More accurate product-image associations
- Consistent display of the highest quality images
- Better handling of variant products
- Improved debugging and logging for troubleshooting
