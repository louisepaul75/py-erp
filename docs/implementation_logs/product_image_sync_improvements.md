# Product Image Synchronization Improvements

**Date:** February 28, 2025

## Overview

This document logs the improvements made to the product image synchronization system to enhance product matching and image prioritization.

## Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Product Matching Logic

The `_find_product` method in `sync_product_images.py` was improved to handle various SKU formats and better match products with images:

- **Multiple Matching Strategies:**
  - Exact match on article number (e.g. "816941")
  - Match as parent product
  - Find specific variants under parent products using variant codes
  - Prefix matching for products with internal suffixes

- **Improved Handling of Variant Codes:**
  - Now properly handles articles with suffix codes like "-BE" in the external system
  - Separates the base article number from variant codes for more accurate matching

- **Enhanced Logging:**
  - Added detailed logging for each matching attempt
  - Clear identification of when and how products are matched

### 2. Strict Image Prioritization

Updated the image selection logic in `product_filters.py` and the product views to implement a strict prioritization hierarchy:

1. Produktfoto with front=True
2. Any Produktfoto
3. Any image with front=True
4. Any image marked as primary
5. First available image

This ensures the most appropriate image is always displayed first in product listings and detail pages.

### 3. API Interaction Improvements

- Modified how articles are processed in the sync command to focus on the base article number
- Updated the product context data in views to ensure proper image selection
- Enhanced error handling for API requests

### 4. Individual Record Processing

**Date Added:** March 15, 2025

Modified the `sync_product_images.py` command to use individual record processing instead of bulk operations:

- **Replaced Bulk Operations:**
  - Changed from `ProductImage.objects.bulk_create` to individual `image.save()` calls
  - Changed from `ProductImage.objects.bulk_update` to individual updates
  - This ensures proper ID generation and sequence usage

- **Enhanced Error Handling:**
  - Added try/except blocks around individual image creation and updates
  - Errors with individual images no longer abort the entire sync process
  - Detailed error logging for troubleshooting specific image issues

- **Database Sequence Integration:**
  - Ensured proper usage of the `products_productimage_id_seq` sequence
  - Fixed potential ID conflicts that could occur with bulk operations
  - Improved compatibility with PostgreSQL's sequence management

- **Performance Considerations:**
  - Added batch processing for primary flag updates
  - Maintained transaction handling for database consistency
  - Optimized page size defaults for better performance

## Testing

These changes were tested with specific SKUs known to have different image types:

- SKU "816941" (Anglerhase) - Confirmed proper handling with multiple image types
- Products with variant codes - Verified matching works with different SKU formats
- Full sync operations - Verified proper ID generation and sequence usage
- Limited sync operations - Tested with various batch sizes and limits

## Benefits

- More accurate product-image associations
- Consistent display of the highest quality images
- Better handling of variant products
- Improved debugging and logging for troubleshooting
- Reliable ID generation for new image records
- Prevention of sequence-related database errors
- Improved error resilience during sync operations
