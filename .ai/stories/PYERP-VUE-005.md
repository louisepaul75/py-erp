# Story: PYERP-VUE-005 - Authentication Implementation in Vue.js Frontend

## Description
As a developer
I want to implement a secure authentication system in the Vue.js frontend
So that users can securely log in, manage their profiles, and access protected resources

## Background
Following the successful migration of the product management module to Vue.js (PYERP-VUE-003), we needed to implement authentication to secure the application and enable user-specific functionality. This story covers the implementation of JWT-based authentication that integrates with Django's authentication system.

## Implementation Status

### Completed Tasks (✅)

#### Authentication Service
- ✅ Created authentication service with TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ Implemented JWT token-based authentication with Django backend
- ✅ Added secure token storage in localStorage
- ✅ Implemented automatic token refresh for seamless user experience
- ✅ Added user profile management functionality
- ✅ Implemented password change functionality

#### API Integration
- ✅ Updated API service to include authentication token handling
- ✅ Added request interceptor to include authentication tokens
- ✅ Implemented response interceptor for token refresh on 401 errors
- ✅ Maintained CSRF token handling for Django compatibility

#### State Management
- ✅ Implemented Pinia store for authentication state
- ✅ Added actions for login, logout, profile updates, and password changes
- ✅ Created getters for user information and authentication status
- ✅ Implemented error handling and loading states

#### Router Guards
- ✅ Created guards for authenticated routes, admin routes, and guest-only routes
- ✅ Implemented redirect logic for unauthorized access
- ✅ Added global navigation guard for routes with requiresAuth meta

#### Authentication Components
- ✅ Created Login component with form validation and error handling
- ✅ Implemented Profile component for viewing and updating user information
- ✅ Added Logout component with redirect to login
- ✅ Updated navigation component with conditional rendering based on auth state
- ✅ Implemented 404 page for handling unknown routes

### Technical Notes
- Authentication Method: JWT tokens with Django REST Framework Simple JWT
- Token Storage: localStorage with secure handling
- State Management: Pinia store with TypeScript interfaces
- Component Architecture: Composition API with TypeScript
- Form Validation: Client-side validation with error handling
- Security Features: Automatic token refresh, protected routes, role-based access control

## Benefits
1. **Improved Security**: JWT-based authentication with automatic token refresh
2. **Better User Experience**: Seamless authentication with proper error handling
3. **Developer Productivity**: Type-safe authentication with TypeScript interfaces
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized authentication state with Pinia
5. **Scalability**: Modular design that can be extended for additional authentication methods

## Next Steps
1. Implement comprehensive testing for authentication components
2. Add remember me functionality for persistent login
3. Enhance security with token expiration handling
4. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication in the future
