# Story: PYERP-VUE-004 - Sales Module Migration to Vue.js

## Description
As a developer
I want to migrate the sales management views from Django templates to Vue.js components
So that we can continue modernizing the UI, improve user experience, and make the application more maintainable

## Background
Following the successful migration of the Product module to Vue.js (PYERP-VUE-003), we have continued our migration efforts with the Sales module. The Sales module is a critical component of the ERP system, handling sales orders, customer information, and invoicing. This migration will enhance the user experience for sales staff and improve the overall efficiency of the sales process.
