# Story: PYERP-187 - Legacy API Server Unavailability Handling

## Description
As a system administrator
I want the pyERP system to gracefully handle legacy ERP server unavailability
So that the system remains operational during legacy ERP outages and automatically recovers when the server becomes available again

## Background
The legacy ERP API integration is a critical component of pyERP, providing access to product data, customer information, and other essential business data. However, the legacy system occasionally experiences downtime for maintenance or due to unexpected issues. During these periods, the pyERP system would previously fail with unhandled exceptions, causing disruption to users and potentially cascading failures in dependent systems.

The current implementation has the following issues:
- Unhandled exceptions when the server is down or unreachable
- Lack of retry mechanisms with appropriate backoff
- No differentiation between different types of connection errors
- Repeated connection attempts even when the server is known to be down
- No graceful fallback behavior for critical operations

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Given the legacy ERP server is temporarily unavailable
   When API requests are made to the legacy system
   Then the system should handle the unavailability gracefully without crashing

2. Given API requests are failing due to server unavailability
   When multiple requests are made in sequence
   Then the system should implement smart retry logic with exponential backoff

3. Given the server has been unavailable for some time
   When the cooldown period has expired
   Then the system should automatically retry the connection

4. Given the legacy ERP server becomes available again after downtime
   When new API requests are made
   Then the system should automatically recover and resume normal operation

5. Given the server is unavailable
   When critical data operations are performed
   Then appropriate fallback behavior should be implemented (empty results, default values, etc.)

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Create a specialized `ServerUnavailableError` exception class
- [ ] Implement detection of different server unavailability scenarios (timeouts, connection refused, DNS failures)
- [ ] Add smart retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Implement server availability tracking with cooldown periods
- [ ] Modify API methods to provide graceful fallbacks instead of exceptions
- [ ] Enhance logging for better visibility of server unavailability
- [ ] Create tests to verify the resilience implementation

## Test Scenarios
1. Server Timeout Handling
   - Setup: Configure connection timeout test
   - Steps: Attempt to connect to the legacy API
   - Expected: System should retry with backoff and eventually handle gracefully

2. Connection Refused Handling
   - Setup: Simulate server that actively refuses connections
   - Steps: Attempt to connect to the legacy API
   - Expected: System should detect server unavailability and apply cooldown

3. Recovery Testing
   - Setup: Simulate server becoming available after downtime
   - Steps: Make API requests before and after server becomes available
   - Expected: System should recover automatically when server is available again

4. Fallback Behavior
   - Setup: Ensure server is unavailable
   - Steps: Perform data operations that require legacy API
   - Expected: Operations should fall back to empty/default results rather than failing

## Dependencies
- [ ] Direct API Client implementation
- [ ] Legacy API integration module
- [ ] Django settings for configuration
