# Testing Implementation Stories

This document outlines user stories for the testing implementation phase of the pyERP project.

## Background

The pyERP system needs comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and maintainability. Due to challenges with Django's app registry and interdependencies between modules, a specialized testing approach has been developed.

## Completed Stories

### Django Mock Framework

**As a** developer  
**I want** a robust mock framework for Django models  
**So that** I can write unit tests without Django app registry dependencies

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Create mock implementations of Django models
- ✅ Simulate QuerySet behavior with filter, get, etc.
- ✅ Provide mock managers for Django model classes
- ✅ Allow testing of business logic without database connections

**Implementation:**
- Created `mock_models.py` with `MockQuerySet`, `MockModelBase`, etc.
- Implemented common Django ORM patterns in mock classes
- Added factory patterns for creating test instances

### Isolated Test Runner

**As a** developer  
**I want** to run specific tests in isolation  
**So that** I can bypass Django's test collection issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Create a script to run specific test modules individually
- ✅ Support running tests with proper Django settings
- ✅ Provide clear output on test success/failure
- ✅ Work with both simple and Django-dependent tests

**Implementation:**
- Created `run_specific_tests.py` using subprocess
- Added environment variable configuration
- Implemented progress tracking and summary reporting

### Basic Test Suite

**As a** developer  
**I want** a minimal test suite that always passes  
**So that** I can verify the test environment is working

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Create basic tests that don't depend on Django
- ✅ Ensure tests run quickly for rapid verification
- ✅ Include both function and class-based tests
- ✅ Document how to run these tests

**Implementation:**
- Created `test_simple.py` with basic assertions
- Added both function and class-based tests
- Ensured tests work with pytest directly

## Upcoming Stories

### Coverage Reporting

**As a** developer  
**I want** comprehensive test coverage reporting  
**So that** I can identify untested code paths

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Integrate pytest-cov for coverage analysis
- Generate HTML reports for easy visualization
- Track coverage metrics over time
- Set up rules for minimum coverage requirements

**Tasks:**
1. Configure pytest-cov in project settings
2. Create scripts to generate and view coverage reports
3. Document coverage expectations for different modules
4. Add coverage badges to documentation

### Continuous Integration Setup

**As a** developer  
**I want** automated test execution in CI/CD  
**So that** code quality issues are caught early

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Configure CI pipeline to run tests automatically
- Enforce test passing before merge acceptance
- Generate and archive test reports
- Alert on test failures

**Tasks:**
1. Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI tool
2. Configure test environments in CI
3. Create notification system for test failures
4. Document CI/CD process for the team

### Integration Test Framework

**As a** developer  
**I want** a framework for testing component integrations  
**So that** I can verify modules work together correctly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create utilities for testing API interactions
- Support mocking external services
- Provide fixtures for common test scenarios
- Document integration test patterns

**Tasks:**
1. Develop API testing helpers
2. Create mock implementations of external services
3. Build common test fixtures
4. Write examples of integration test patterns

### UI Test Implementation

**As a** developer  
**I want** automated UI tests  
**So that** I can verify frontend behavior

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Set up Selenium or similar for UI testing
- Create helpers for common UI interactions
- Support testing across different browsers
- Document UI test patterns and practices

**Tasks:**
1. Select and configure UI testing framework
2. Create page object models for application screens
3. Implement common UI interaction patterns
4. Document UI testing approach
