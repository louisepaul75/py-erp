# Story: PYERP-VUE-003 - Product Module Migration to Vue.js

## Description
As a developer
I want to migrate the product management views from Django templates to Vue.js components
So that we can modernize the UI, improve user experience, and make the application more maintainable

## Background
Following the successful setup of the Vue.js infrastructure (PYERP-VUE-001 and PYERP-VUE-002), we have begun migrating actual business functionality from Django templates to Vue.js components. The product management module was selected as the first candidate for migration due to its relatively self-contained nature and high visibility to users.

## Implementation Status

### Completed Tasks (✅)

#### Router Setup
- ✅ Created Vue Router configuration with routes for all product-related views
- ✅ Implemented navigation between components
- ✅ Set up proper route parameters for product and variant details

#### API Service
- ✅ Created API service to interact with the Django backend
- ✅ Implemented CSRF token handling for secure API requests
- ✅ Set up endpoints for products, variants, and categories

#### Vue Components
- ✅ Created Home.vue component as the landing page
- ✅ Migrated ProductList.vue with search and filtering functionality
- ✅ Migrated ProductDetail.vue with image gallery and detailed information
- ✅ Migrated VariantDetail.vue with pricing and inventory information
- ✅ Migrated CategoryList.vue for browsing product categories

#### UI/UX Improvements
- ✅ Implemented responsive layouts using CSS Grid
- ✅ Added loading states and error handling
- ✅ Improved navigation with back buttons and breadcrumbs
- ✅ Enhanced image viewing with thumbnails and gallery

### Pending Tasks

- ⬜ Ensure Django API endpoints return data in the expected format
- ✅ Implement authentication in the Vue frontend
- ✅ Add login/logout functionality
- ⬜ Write unit tests for Vue components
- ⬜ Configure the build process for production
- ⬜ Set up proper static file serving from Django

## Technical Notes
- Vue.js Version: 3.5
- Router: Vue Router 4.x
- HTTP Client: Axios
- State Management: Pinia
- CSS: Custom styling with responsive design
- Component Architecture: Composition API with TypeScript
- Authentication: JWT-based with automatic token refresh

## Next Steps
1. Test the migrated components with real data from the Django backend
2. Address any API format mismatches
3. ✅ Implement authentication and authorization
4. Begin migration of the next module (Sales or Inventory)
