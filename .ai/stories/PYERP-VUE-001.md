# Story: PYERP-VUE-001 - Vue.js Integration Phase 1: Initial Setup

## Description
As a developer
I want to set up the initial Vue.js infrastructure within our Django application
So that we can begin modernizing our frontend with a component-based architecture

## Background
Currently, the application uses Django templates with AJAX for real-time updates. To modernize our frontend and improve the user experience, we're introducing Vue.js 3 with TypeScript. This story covers the initial setup and infrastructure phase.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Given I am setting up a new development environment
   When I clone the repository and run the setup commands
   Then the Vue.js development environment should be properly initialized with hot-reload capability

2. Given I am developing a Vue.js component
   When I make changes to the component
   Then the changes should be immediately reflected without full page reload

3. Given I am building the application for production
   When I run the build command
   Then Vue.js assets should be properly bundled and integrated with Django's static files

4. Given I am making API calls from Vue.js components
   When I interact with the backend
   Then the requests should properly handle CSRF tokens and authentication

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Setup Vue.js 3 project structure within Django
  - Configure Vite as build tool
  - Setup TypeScript configuration
  - Configure ESLint and Prettier
  - Setup Jest for unit testing

- [ ] Configure Build Pipeline
  - Setup development and production build configurations
  - Configure static asset handling
  - Setup source maps for debugging
  - Configure code splitting

- [ ] Django Integration
  - Create Vue.js entry points in Django templates
  - Configure Django to serve Vue.js assets
  - Setup API endpoints for Vue.js components
  - Configure CSRF token handling

- [ ] Development Environment
  - Configure hot module replacement
  - Setup TypeScript type checking
  - Configure debugging tools
  - Setup component development environment

## Test Scenarios
1. Development Environment
   - Setup: Fresh clone of repository
   - Steps: Run setup commands
   - Expected: Development environment starts with hot-reload

2. Build Process
   - Setup: Development environment
   - Steps: Run production build
   - Expected: Optimized assets in Django static directory

3. API Integration
   - Setup: Development environment
   - Steps: Make API call from Vue component
   - Expected: Successful authenticated request

## Dependencies
- [ ] Node.js and npm in development environment
- [ ] Django static files configuration
- [ ] CORS and CSRF configuration
- [ ] Development and production environment variables

## Estimation
- Story Points: 8
- Time Estimate: 5 days

## Technical Notes
- Vue.js Version: 3.x
- Build Tool: Vite
- Package Manager: npm
- Testing Framework: Jest
- Code Quality: ESLint + Prettier
- CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS
