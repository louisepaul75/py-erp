# Story: PYERP-201 - External API Access Implementation

## Description
As a system integrator
I want to access pyERP data through a secure REST API
So that I can integrate external applications with the ERP system

## Background
The pyERP system currently has limited API capabilities, primarily focused on internal use and legacy system integration. As the system matures, there is a growing need for external applications to access and manipulate data in a secure, controlled manner. This includes e-commerce platforms, mobile applications, business intelligence tools, and custom client applications.

The current API infrastructure includes:
- Basic JWT authentication
- Some internal API endpoints for the web frontend
- Legacy API integration for the 4D-based system
- Swagger documentation framework

However, a comprehensive, secure, and well-documented external API is needed to enable third-party integrations and extend the system's capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Given I am a system integrator
   When I need to authenticate with the API
   Then I should be able to obtain a JWT token with appropriate scopes

2. Given I have a valid API token
   When I access product data through the API
   Then I should receive properly formatted JSON responses with pagination

3. Given I have a valid API token with write permissions
   When I create or update data through the API
   Then the changes should be validated and applied according to business rules

4. Given I am a developer
   When I need to understand the API capabilities
   Then I should have access to comprehensive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

5. Given I am a system administrator
   When external applications access the API
   Then all access should be logged for audit purposes

6. Given I am a system administrator
   When managing API access
   Then I should be able to create, revoke, and limit API tokens

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Implement OAuth2/JWT authentication with scoped tokens
- [ ] Create serializers for core business entities (products, orders, inventory)
- [ ] Implement viewsets with proper permission controls
- [ ] Add filtering, sorting, and pagination to all list endpoints
- [ ] Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- [ ] Implement audit logging for all API access
- [ ] Create an API key management interface for administrators
- [ ] Implement API versioning to ensure backward compatibility
- [ ] Add proper error handling and consistent response formats

## Test Scenarios
1. Authentication Flow
   - Setup: Configure test client with API credentials
   - Steps: Request authentication token
   - Expected: Receive valid JWT token with appropriate expiration

2. Data Retrieval
   - Setup: Create test data and authenticate
   - Steps: Query product list with filters and pagination
   - Expected: Receive properly formatted JSON with correct pagination headers

3. Data Modification
   - Setup: Authenticate with write permissions
   - Steps: Create a new order through the API
   - Expected: Order is created with proper validation and business rules applied

4. Permission Control
   - Setup: Authenticate with read-only token
   - Steps: Attempt to modify data
   - Expected: Receive 403 Forbidden response

5. Rate Limiting
   - Setup: Configure rate limits and authenticate
   - Steps: Make rapid successive requests
   - Expected: Receive 429 Too Many Requests after limit is reached

## Dependencies
- [ ] Django REST Framework
- [ ] djangorestframework-simplejwt
- [ ] drf-yasg for Swagger documentation
- [ ] django-filter for advanced filtering

## Estimation
- Story Points: 13
- Time Estimate: 3 weeks
