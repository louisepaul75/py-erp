# Story: PYERP-SYS-001 - Admin Status Dashboard Implementation

## Description
As a system administrator
I want a centralized status dashboard in the admin view
So that I can quickly monitor the health of critical system connections and components

## Background
The pyERP system depends on several critical connections to function properly, including database connections, legacy ERP system integration, and the pictures API. Currently, there is no centralized way to monitor the health of these connections, making it difficult to quickly identify and troubleshoot issues when they arise. A dedicated status dashboard in the admin view would provide administrators with real-time visibility into the health of these critical systems.

## Implementation Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - May 2024

The admin status dashboard has been successfully implemented with all core features. The implementation includes a comprehensive monitoring system with visual status indicators, detailed error information, and multiple access methods including a web dashboard, API endpoint, and CLI tool.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Given I am logged in as an administrator
   When I navigate to the admin dashboard
   Then I should see a "System Status" section or page
   ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Added to admin site with dedicated dashboard view

2. Given I am viewing the System Status dashboard
   When the page loads or is refreshed
   Then I should see the current status of the database connection with a visual indicator (green/yellow/red)
   ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Shows real-time database connection status with color coding

3. Given I am viewing the System Status dashboard
   When the page loads or is refreshed
   Then I should see the current status of the legacy ERP connection with a visual indicator
   ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Displays legacy ERP connection status with detailed diagnostics

4. Given I am viewing the System Status dashboard
   When the page loads or is refreshed
   Then I should see the current status of the pictures API connection with a visual indicator
   ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Shows pictures API connection status with response time metrics

5. Given I am viewing the System Status dashboard
   When a connection is having issues
   Then I should see detailed error information and troubleshooting steps
   ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Displays detailed error messages and diagnostic information

6. Given I am viewing the System Status dashboard
   When I click a "Refresh" button
   Then the system should perform fresh health checks on all monitored components
   ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Added refresh button with loading indicator and status feedback

4. Pictures API Connection Issue
   - Setup: Simulate pictures API timeout or error
   - Steps: Load admin status dashboard
   - Expected: Pictures API indicator should show warning or error state
   - ✅ **VERIFIED**

5. Manual Refresh
   - Setup: Any system state
   - Steps: Click refresh button on dashboard
   - Expected: System should perform new health checks and update status indicators
   - ✅ **VERIFIED**

## Dependencies
