# Test Coverage Improvement Initiative

## Context & Background

As part of our commitment to code quality and stability, we're implementing a structured test coverage improvement initiative for the pyERP project. Currently, the overall test coverage stands at 8%, with only the core validators module having reasonable coverage (approximately 79%). This low coverage increases the risk of bugs, regression issues, and makes future development more challenging.

## Objectives

1. **Short-term Goal (1 month)**: Increase overall coverage to 30%, focusing on core modules
2. **Medium-term Goal (3 months)**: Increase overall coverage to 60%, covering all public APIs
3. **Long-term Goal (6 months)**: Maintain coverage above 80% across all modules

## Implementation Strategy

We've designed a phased approach to systematically improve test coverage:

### Phase 1: Core Framework (Weeks 1-2)

- **Focus Areas**: 
  - Core validators
  - Form validation
  - Core utilities
  - Views and API endpoints

- **Target Components**:
  - `pyerp/core/validators.py` (target: 95% coverage)
  - `pyerp/core/views.py` (target: 80% coverage)
  - `pyerp/core/form_validation.py` (target: 80% coverage)

- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Complete tests for validator classes
  - Test edge cases and validation logic
  - Implement view tests with mock requests
  - Test form validation with valid/invalid data scenarios

### Phase 2: Business Logic (Weeks 3-4)

- **Focus Areas**:
  - Product module business logic
  - Inventory logic
  - Sales logic

- **Target Components**:
  - `pyerp/products/*.py` (target: 80% coverage)
  - `pyerp/inventory/*.py` (target: 70% coverage) 
  - `pyerp/sales/*.py` (target: 70% coverage)

- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Test model methods and business rules
  - Test product workflows (creation, updates)
  - Test pricing and availability logic
  - Test inventory operations and stock management

### Phase 3: Integration Points (Weeks 5-6)

- **Focus Areas**:
  - Legacy sync modules
  - API endpoints
  - Management commands

- **Target Components**:
  - `pyerp/legacy_sync/*.py` (target: 60% coverage)
  - `pyerp/*/api.py` (target: 80% coverage)
  - `pyerp/management/commands/*.py` (target: 70% coverage)

- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Test data import/export functionality
  - Test API authentication and responses
  - Test command execution and parameter handling
  - Implement integration tests for key workflows

## Tools & Resources

We've developed several tools to support this initiative:

1. **find_low_coverage.py**: Analyzes coverage data to identify modules with low coverage
   - Sorts modules by coverage percentage
   - Groups results by directory for targeted improvements
   - Reports detailed coverage statistics for planning

2. **find_untested_modules.py**: Identifies modules with no tests at all
   - Categorizes untested modules by type
   - Prioritizes modules based on business importance
   - Provides a clear starting point for test creation

3. **test_template.py**: Example test implementations for different component types
   - Model test examples
   - Form validation test examples
   - View test examples
   - API test examples
   - Management command test examples

4. **run_specific_tests.py**: Custom testing script to avoid Django app registry issues
   - Sets Django environment
   - Allows running specific test modules
   - Tracks test results and generates coverage reports

## Best Practices

Throughout this initiative, we'll follow these testing best practices:

1. **Mocking Strategy**:
   - Mock database access for unit tests
   - Create consistent fixtures for test data
   - Mock external API services

2. **Test Organization**:
   - Place unit tests in `tests/unit/`
   - Place integration tests in `tests/integration/`
   - Name test files `test_<module_name>.py`
   - Name test methods `test_<behavior_being_tested>`

3. **Test Structure**:
   - Focus on small, specific test cases
   - Use descriptive docstrings
   - Group related tests into classes
   - Use pytest fixtures for setup/teardown

## Progress Tracking

We'll track progress using the following methods:

1. **Weekly Coverage Reports**:
   - Generate weekly coverage reports
   - Compare against targets
   - Identify gaps and adjust priorities

2. **Visual Dashboard**:
   - Create visual representation of coverage progress
   - Track coverage by module/component
   - Show trend over time

3. **Code Review Integration**:
   - Include coverage metrics in code reviews
   - Require tests for new features
   - Prevent coverage decreases

## Current Status

- Created test coverage improvement plan document
- Developed coverage analysis tools
- Created test template examples
- Implemented initial tests for core views
- **Next Steps**: Implement Phase 1 testing for core validators and forms

## Implementation Example: Core Views

We've started implementing tests for `pyerp/core/views.py` as an example of our approach. These tests demonstrate:

1. Proper mocking of database connections
2. Testing of API endpoints
3. Validation of success and error scenarios
4. Comprehensive assertion of response data

This implementation serves as a model for testing other views and API endpoints throughout the codebase.

## Conclusion

By following this structured approach to test coverage improvement, we'll systematically reduce risk, improve code quality, and build a more maintainable codebase. The phased implementation ensures we prioritize the most critical components first while making steady progress toward our overall coverage goals.
