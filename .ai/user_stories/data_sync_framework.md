# Data Synchronization Framework User Stories

## Overview
These user stories cover the implementation of a scalable data synchronization framework to replace the current individual scripts for product import. This framework will enable synchronizing multiple data entities from the legacy 4D system to the new pyERP system, and support both one-time imports and regular incremental updates.

## User Stories

### Phase 1: Framework Foundation

#### US-DF101: Modular ETL Architecture
**As a** System Administrator
**I want to** have a modular ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) framework
**So that** I can efficiently synchronize data from multiple tables in the legacy system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The framework separates concerns between data extraction, transformation, and loading
- Standardized interfaces exist for each phase of the ETL process
- Common functionality is abstracted into base classes
- The architecture supports adding new data sources and targets with minimal code changes
- Existing functionality (parent product and variant import) is preserved

#### US-DF102: Configuration-Driven Approach
**As a** System Administrator
**I want to** configure data synchronization through configuration files
**So that** I can adapt the process without changing code

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- YAML/JSON configuration files define the data synchronization process
- Field mappings between legacy and new systems are declaratively defined
- Table/entity dependencies are specified in configuration
- Validation rules can be defined per entity type
- Environment-specific settings can be configured (dev, test, production)

#### US-DF103: Data Source Abstraction
**As a** Developer
**I want to** have a consistent interface for accessing legacy data
**So that** I can easily add support for new data sources

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Abstract base classes exist for different data source types (API, direct DB, file)
- The SimpleAPIClient integration is maintained but refactored to fit the abstraction
- Connectors include standardized error handling
- Data source configuration is externalized
- Authentication mechanisms are properly encapsulated

### Phase 2: Scheduling & Orchestration

#### US-DF201: Task Scheduling
**As a** System Administrator
**I want to** schedule data synchronization tasks
**So that** data is regularly updated without manual intervention

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Tasks can be scheduled to run on a regular basis
- Both cron-based and interval-based scheduling is supported
- Task dependencies can be defined (e.g., sync products before orders)
- Scheduled tasks appear in admin interface with last run status
- Task scheduling configuration can be updated without restart

#### US-DF202: Asynchronous Execution
**As a** System Administrator
**I want to** run data synchronization tasks asynchronously
**So that** long-running tasks don't block user interfaces

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Integration with Celery for asynchronous execution
- Task progress reporting during execution
- Ability to cancel running tasks
- Resource allocation control (memory, CPU)
- Queuing system for organizing task execution

#### US-DF203: Workflow Orchestration
**As a** System Administrator
**I want to** define complex synchronization workflows
**So that** I can manage dependencies between different data entities

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Support for Apache Airflow DAGs for complex workflows
- Visual representation of synchronization workflows
- Conditional execution based on task success/failure
- Parallel execution when dependencies allow
- Handling of cross-entity references

### Phase 3: Resilience & Monitoring

#### US-DF301: Transaction Management
**As a** System Administrator
**I want to** ensure data consistency during synchronization
**So that** system data remains valid even if tasks fail

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Data changes are wrapped in database transactions
- Partial failures are properly rolled back
- Atomicity for related data updates
- Proper handling of unique constraints
- Foreign key constraint management

#### US-DF302: Error Handling & Retry
**As a** System Administrator
**I want to** have robust error handling with retry capability
**So that** temporary failures don't require manual intervention

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Standardized error handling across all synchronization tasks
- Configurable retry logic with backoff
- Differentiation between recoverable and non-recoverable errors
- Detailed error reporting with context information
- Manual retry option for failed tasks

#### US-DF303: Monitoring Dashboard
**As a** System Administrator
**I want to** monitor synchronization tasks via a dashboard
**So that** I can quickly identify and address issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dashboard showing current and historical task status
- Performance metrics for synchronization tasks
- Filtering and search capabilities for logs
- Visualization of error trends
- Export functionality for logs and metrics

### Phase 4: Incremental Updates

#### US-DF401: Delta Synchronization
**As a** System Administrator
**I want to** perform incremental updates rather than full imports
**So that** synchronization is more efficient and less resource-intensive

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Change tracking to identify modified records
- Timestamp-based delta synchronization
- Checksum/hash comparison for detecting changes
- Support for soft-deleted records
- Configurable change detection strategies per entity

#### US-DF402: Conflict Resolution
**As a** System Administrator
**I want to** have defined conflict resolution strategies
**So that** data inconsistencies are handled gracefully

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Configurable conflict resolution strategies (newest wins, manual review, etc.)
- Detection of conflicting changes
- Logging of conflict resolution actions
- Manual override capability for resolving conflicts
- Notification system for conflicts requiring attention
