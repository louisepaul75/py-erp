# Forecasting Engine

This module provides forecasting capabilities based on data within the pyERP system.

**Features:**

*   (Planned) Demand Forecasting (Product Level)
*   (Planned) Financial Forecasting (Business Level)
*   (Planned) Seasonality and Trend Analysis

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Designed for clean separation from the core ERP functionality.
*   Leverages historical data from sales, production, and finance modules.
*   Potential approaches include statistical time series models and machine learning techniques.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Data Foundation

*   **Source Identification:** Identify specific data points within pyERP (sales history, production records, inventory levels, financial data, etc.).
*   **Data Quality & Availability:** Assess the quality, completeness, and granularity of historical data.
*   **Data Extraction/Pipeline:** Define the ETL process (batch or real-time) for feeding forecasting models.

### 2. Forecasting Approaches

*   **Statistical Methods:** Explore traditional time series models like ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters) for interpretability and handling seasonality explicitly.
*   **Machine Learning (ML) Methods:** Investigate regression (Linear, Ridge), tree-based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), and potentially deep learning (LSTMs) for complex patterns and incorporating external factors.

### 3. Key Considerations

*   **Seasonality & Factors:** Ensure models handle seasonality (built-in for statistical, feature engineering for ML) and allow incorporating other drivers.
*   **Forecast Granularity:** Address needs for both low-level (product-specific) and high-level (overall financial) forecasts.
*   **Interpretability:** Balance the need for accuracy with the ability to understand forecast drivers (statistical models are often clearer).
*   **Scalability & Maintenance:** Plan for managing potentially many models and retraining them efficiently.
*   **Integration:** Determine how the engine will integrate with pyERP (internal module vs. microservice) and how users will interact.

### 4. Recommended Strategy

*   **Hybrid Approach:** Start with statistical models as a baseline, augment with ML where needed for complexity or external factors.
*   **Start Focused:** Implement a pilot project (e.g., sales forecast for one category) to refine the process.
*   **Data Exploration:** Prioritize exploring pyERP database schema and data availability.
