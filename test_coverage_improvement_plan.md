## 4. Test Implementation Best Practices

### Mocking Strategy

1. **External Services**
   - Use `unittest.mock` to mock external API calls
   - Create detailed mock responses for different scenarios
   - Test with both success and error responses

2. **Database Access**
   - Use Django's `TestCase` for database tests
   - Create fixtures for common test data
   - Use factories for complex object creation

3. **Authentication**
   - Mock user authentication for view tests
   - Test with different permission levels
   - Test unauthorized access scenarios

### Test Organization

1. **Test Location**
   - Place tests in a `tests` directory within each module
   - Organize tests to match the structure of the module being tested
   - Group related tests in test classes

2. **Naming Convention**
   - Name test files `test_<module_name>.py`
   - Name test classes `Test<ClassBeingTested>`
   - Name test methods `test_<behavior_being_tested>`

3. **Test Isolation**
   - Each test should be independent
   - Avoid dependencies between tests
   - Use setUp and tearDown methods for test setup/cleanup

## 5. Tools and Resources

1. **Coverage Tools**
   - Run `python -m pytest --cov=pyerp --cov-report=html` for detailed reports
   - Review `htmlcov/index.html` for coverage details

2. **Test Templates**
   - Refer to existing tests in the codebase for patterns
   - Use the unit-testing document for guidance on test structure

3. **Continuous Integration**
   - Configure CI to run tests and report coverage
   - Set up coverage thresholds to prevent decreases

## 6. Success Criteria

1. **Short-term Goal** (2 weeks)
   - Increase overall coverage to 60%
   - Focus on critical business logic modules

2. **Medium-term Goal** (6 weeks)
   - Increase overall coverage to 70% 
   - Cover all public APIs and key business logic

3. **Long-term Goal** (3 months)
   - Maintain coverage above 80%
   - Implement test-driven development for new features
